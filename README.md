# md2SciNote

**md2scinote** is a rude little python program that converts notes with latex taken in markdown into html using [strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/).  
Math is delimited by \( and \) (inline) and \[ and \] and is rendered with MathJax.
Output from the linux `date` command is formatted by the parser.

`mdgen LOG` produces an html file LOG.html.
